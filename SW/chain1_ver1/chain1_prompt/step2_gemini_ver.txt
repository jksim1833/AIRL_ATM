[Instruction]
From the previous step, locate the single piece of luggage that was identified as the most suitable for volume estimation and output its position using precise percentage coordinates.

[Output Requirements]

1. Luggage Confirmation:

- "luggage_description": Provide a brief, clear one-sentence description of the luggage selected in the previous step (e.g., "The gray suitcase located in the center").
- This description is crucial for verifying that the coordinates correspond to the correct item.

2. Coordinate Calculation:

- Consider the entire image as a 100% width x 100% height coordinate system.

- Find the exact geometric center of the selected luggage and calculate the following three values as percentages:

"center_x_percent": The x coordinate of the luggage's geometric center (0.0 to 100.0)

"center_y_percent": The y coordinate of the luggage's geometric center (0.0 to 100.0)

"diameter_percent": The diameter of a circle to clearly mark the center (5.0 to 20.0, as a percentage of the image's width).

- Critical Directive: The circle must be positioned at the precise geometric center of the luggage. The diameter should be appropriately sized—not too large or too small—to clearly indicate the selected luggage.

[Output Format]
Respond only with the requested information (description and coordinates) in the following JSON format. Do not include any additional explanations or sentences.

{
  "luggage_description": "string",
  "coordinates": {
    "center_x_percent": float,
    "center_y_percent": float,
    "diameter_percent": float
  }
