[Role and Objective]
Analyze the provided image to identify the single piece of luggage best suited for volume estimation. Then, output its location using precise percentage coordinates.

[Analysis and Selection Criteria]
Evaluate each piece of luggage based on the following criteria to choose the most suitable one for volume estimation:
- Shape Regularity: Geometrically distinct and regular shape (e.g., cuboid) that simplifies volume calculation.
- Surface Visibility: Three main surfaces (length, width, height) or sufficient visual cues are visible to infer its 3D shape.
- Relative Size: Large enough within the image for accurate measurement.
- Angle and Perspective: The angle and position of the luggage aid in precise volume estimation.

[Output Requirements]
1. Luggage Confirmation:
- "luggage_description": Provide a brief, one-sentence description of the selected luggage (e.g., "The gray suitcase in the center") to confirm the coordinates match the correct item.

2. Coordinate Calculation:
- View the image as a 100% x 100% coordinate system.
- The center point must be the **2D geometric center** of the luggage as it appears in the image, ignoring any 3D depth. This should be the visually perceived center.
- Use the input image's dimensions ({image_width}px, {image_height}px) for the most accurate estimation.
- "center_x_percent": The x-coordinate of the 2D geometric center (0.0 to 100.0).
- "center_y_percent": The y-coordinate of the 2D geometric center (0.0 to 100.0).
- "diameter_percent": The diameter of a circle to mark the center, as a percentage of the image's width (5.0 to 20.0). It should be appropriately sized to clearly indicate the item without being too large or too small.

[Output Format]
Respond ONLY with a JSON object. Ensure no other text or explanation is included.
