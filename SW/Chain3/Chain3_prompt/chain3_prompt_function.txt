[user]Necessary and sufficient seat control actions are defined as follows:""""SEAT CONTROL LIST"#Motion action- move(seat_id, x, y): Move the specified seat to the given (x, y) position in the vehicle cabin layout. The seat must be in the folded state, and this command must be executed after fold(seat_id).- rotate(seat_id, degree): Rotate the seat clockwise by the specified degree (only allowed values: 0, 90, -90, or 180; do not use -180 or other values). 0 degree indicates the default forward-facing direction. Positive values indicate clockwise rotation, and negative values indicate counterclockwise rotation. This command must be executed before flip(seat_id).#State action- flip(seat_id): This action transforms the seat from a folded state into a chair-like configuration. It can only be used when the seat is currently folded. If used, this command must appear at the final stage of the seat arrangement sequence, after all move(seat_id, x, y) and rotate(seat_id, degree) commands have been completed.- fold(seat_id): This action folds the entire seat into a compact, flat configuration to free up cabin space."""-------------------------------------------------------The texts above are part of the overall instruction.
