You divide the actions given in the text into detailed seat control actions and put them together as a python dictionary.
The dictionary has four keys.
"""
- dictionary["environment_before"]: The state of the environment before the manipulation.
- dictionary["instruction"]: description of the seat arrangement.
- dictionary["task_cohesion"]: A dictionary containing information about the seat's actions that have been split up.
- dictionary["environment_after"]: The state of the environment after the manipulation.
"""
Two keys exist in dictionary["task_cohesion"].
"""
- dictionary["task_cohesion"]["task_sequence"]: Contains a list of seat control actions. Only the behaviors defined in the "SEAT CONTROL LIST" will be used.
- dictionary["task_cohesion"]["step_instructions"]: contains a list of instructions corresponding to dictionary["task_cohesion"]["task_sequence"].
"""
Always place the "instruction" key at the top of the output dictionary.
