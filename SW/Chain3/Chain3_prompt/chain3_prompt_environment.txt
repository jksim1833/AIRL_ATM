Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":{
	"objects": ["seat_1"],
    	"object_states": {"seat_1": { "type": "seat", "position": [1, 1], "direction": "forward"}}}}
"""
Object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- type: "seat" or "storage". physical form of the seat. 
- position: [x, y] coordinate of the seat. x, y must be integers in the range 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2.
- direction: "forward", "backward", "left", or "right". This indicates the seat's orientation relative to the fixed forward direction of the vehicle. The vehicle’s forward direction is constant and does not change based on seat movement.
