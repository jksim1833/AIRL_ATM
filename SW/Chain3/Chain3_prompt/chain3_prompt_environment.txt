Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":{
	"objects": ["seat_1"],
    	"object_states": {"seat_1": { "type": "chair", "position": [1, 1], "direction": "forward"}}}}
"""
Object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- type: "chair" or "storage". physical form of the seat. 

- position: [x, y] coordinate of the seat. x, y must be integers in the range 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2.
Each seat (seat_1 to seat_4) is controlled independently in separate physical regions. Even if their coordinates overlap, there is no physical conflict between them. 

- direction: "forward", "backward", "left", or "right". Fixed directions based on the vehicle. It does NOT represent the rotation direction (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise).

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
