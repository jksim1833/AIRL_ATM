Start working. Resume from the environment below.
"""
{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}
"""
The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}
"""
The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. Make sure that each element of the ["step_instructions"] explains corresponding element of the ["task_sequence"]. Refer to the "SEAT CONTROL LIST" to understand the elements of ["task_sequence"].
2. The length of the ["step_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["task_sequence"] list.
3. Never left ',' at the end of the list.
4. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
5. Use the "STATE LIST" for the "object states" field.
"""
"STATE LIST"
- type: "chair" or "storage". physical form of the seat. 
- position: [x, y] coordinate of the seat. x, y must be integers in the range 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2.
- direction: "forward", "backward", "left", or "right". Fixed directions based on the vehicle. It does NOT represent the rotation direction (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise).
"""
6. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
7. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response. Do not include the word "json" after the opening backticks. Only use plain backticks (```).
8. Make sure that your seat control sequence obeys the following constraints:
- move(seat_id, x, y) can only be used when the seat is in the "storage" state.
- rotate(seat_id, degree) must be executed before flip(seat_id).
- flip(seat_id) must appear at the final stage of the sequence.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the eight rules. Think step by step.
