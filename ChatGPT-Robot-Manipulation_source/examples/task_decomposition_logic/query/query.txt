Start working. Resume from the environment below.
"""
{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}
"""
The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": "[INSTRUCTION]"}
"""
The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. The first element should be move_hand() to move the robot hand closer to the object. 
2. Even though objects disappear, do not delete them from the environment and use the "STATE LIST" to keep track of all the objects. 
3. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation. For example, grasping should not occur in successive steps.
4. Never left ',' at the end of the list.
5. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
6. Insert comments every single lines.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Think step by step. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
