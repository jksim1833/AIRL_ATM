Necessary and sufficient robot actions are defined as follows:
"""
"ROBOT ACTION LIST"
move_hand(): Move the robot hand from one position to another with/without grasping an object.
grasp_object(): Grasp an object.
release_object(): Release an object in the robot hand.
detach_from_plane(): Move the grabbed object from a state in which it is constrained by a plane to a state in which it is not constrained by any plane. For example, detach_from_plane() is used when a robot hand grabs an object on the floor and lifts it.
attach_to_plane(): The opposite operation of detach_from_plane().
open_by_rotate(): Open something by rotating an object that is rotationally constrained by its environment along its rotation. For example, when opening a refrigerator, the refrigerator handle makes this motion. Also, when opening the lid of a plastic bottle, the lid makes this motion.
adjust_by_rotate(): Rotate an object that is rotationally constrained by its environment along its rotation. For example, when adjusting the temperature of a refrigerator, the temperature knob makes this motion.
close_by_rotate(): The opposite operation of open_by_rotate().
open_by_slide(): Moves an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when opening a sliding door or drawer, the handle makes this movement.
adjust_by_slide(): Slide an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when widen the gap between a sliding door and the wall, the handle makes this movement.
close_by_slide(): The opposite operation of open_by_slide().
wipe_on_plane(): Move an object landing on a plane along two axes along that plane. For example, when wiping a window with a sponge, the sponge makes this motion.
check_best_by_date(): Check the best-by date of an object in hand. It returns True if the best-by date is not expired, and False otherwise.
