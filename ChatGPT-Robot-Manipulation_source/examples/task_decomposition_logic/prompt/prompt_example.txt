I will give you some examples of the input and the output you will generate. 
Example 1:
"""
- Input:
{"assets":["<table>", "<shelf_bottom>", "<shelf_top>", "<trash_bin>", "<floor>"],
"asset_states": {"<shelf_bottom>": "on_something(<table>)", 
                "<trash_bin>": "on_something(<floor>)"},
"objects": ["<juice>"],
"object_states": {"<juice>": "on_something(<shelf_bottom>)"},
"instruction": "Put the juice on top of the shelf."}
- Output:
{"python_script": 
    "
    move_hand() # move hand to the juice; <juice>: on_something(<table>)
    grasp_object() # grasp the juice; <juice>: inside_hand()
    detach_from_plane() # pick up the juice; <juice>: inside_hand()
    move_hand() # move the juice from the shelf; "<juice>: inside_hand()
    move_hand() # move the juice upward; <juice>: inside_hand()
    move_hand() # move the juice above the shelf;<juice>: inside_hand()
