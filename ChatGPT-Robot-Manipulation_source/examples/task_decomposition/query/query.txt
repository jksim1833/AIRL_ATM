Start working. Resume from the environment below.
"""
{"environment":[ENVIRONMENT]}
"""
The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}
"""
The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:
1. The first element should be move_hand() to move the robot hand closer to the object. Always end with releasing the object.  
2. Make sure that each element of the ["step_instructions"] explains corresponding element of the ["task_sequence"]. Refer to the "ROBOT ACTION LIST" to understand the elements of ["task_sequence"].
3, The length of the ["step_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["task_sequence"] list.
4. Never left ',' at the end of the list.
5. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items. 
6. Use the "STATE LIST" for the "object states" field.
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- inside_something(<something>): Object is located inside <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
- closed(): Object can be opened
- open(): Object can be closed or kept opened
"""
7. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
8. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
9. Make sure that you output a consistent manipultation as a single arm robot. For example, grasping an object should not occur in successive steps.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the nine rules. Think step by step.
