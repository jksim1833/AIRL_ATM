Necessary and sufficient robot actions are defined as follows:
"""
"ROBOT ACTION LIST"
- move_hand(): Move the robot hand from one position to another with/without grasping an object.
- grasp_object(): Grab an object.
- release_object(): Release an object in the robot hand.
- move_object(): Move the object grabbed by the robot hand from one position to another. move_object() is allowed only when the object is not physically constrained by the environment. For example, if the robot hand moves an object on the floor to another location, move_object() is not allowed because the object is constrained by the floor. 
- detach_from_plane(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Move the grabbed object from a state in which it is constrained by a plane to a state in which it is not constrained by any plane. For example, detach_from_plane() is used when a robot hand picks up an object on a table.
- attach_to_plane(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of detach_from_plane().
- open_by_rotate(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Open something by rotating an object that is rotationally constrained by its environment along its rotation. For example, when opening a refrigerator, the refrigerator handle makes this motion. Also, when opening the lid of a plastic bottle, the lid makes this motion.
- adjust_by_rotate(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Rotate an object that is rotationally constrained by its environment along its rotation. For example, when adjusting the temperature of a refrigerator, the temperature knob makes this motion.
- close_by_rotate(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of open_by_rotate().
- open_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Moves an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when opening a sliding door or drawer, the handle makes this movement.
- adjust_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Slide an object that is translationally constrained in two axes from its environment along one unbounded axis. For example, when widen the gap between a sliding door and the wall, the handle makes this movement.
- close_by_slide(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. The opposite operation of open_by_slide().
- wipe_on_plane(): This action can only be performed if an object is grabbed. Move an object landing on a plane along two axes along that plane. For example, when wiping a window with a sponge, the sponge makes this motion.
